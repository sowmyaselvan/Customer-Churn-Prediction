Customer Churn Prediction:
Bank Customer Churn Prediction project aimed at predicting customer churn for a bank using various machine learning algorithms and finding the best one. Customer churn, or the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company, is a critical metric for any business, including banks. By predicting churn, banks can proactively identify at-risk customers and take appropriate measures to retain them, ultimately reducing revenue loss.

In this project, a dataset containing historical customer information, including demographics, transactional data, and customer interactions is used. The steps involved are preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights, and engineer relevant features for model training.

I have experimented with various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting methods and many more to build predictive models. We evaluate the models using appropriate performance metrics and select the best-performing model for deployment.

This project serves as a valuable resource for data scientists, analysts, and banking professionals interested in customer churn prediction and machine learning.
